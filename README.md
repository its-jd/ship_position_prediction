# ship_position_prediction

This notebook contains solution for predicting position of the Ship at time step k+1 given last  k observations of the various parameters. Link for the dataset is given in the notebook.

As this task  was less about perfect results and more about knowing about how I code, how I comment, how I visualize intermediate steps etc. in Jupyter Notebooks to decide the upon supervision of one of the project. Because of this reason I haven't given much of the time in hyperparameter tuning but in the end I have described a little bit about hyperparameter tuning.
